#This document will be used to provide execution instructions.
#In order to execute the application, you have the next two options:

#1) Open the proyect  in a windows IDE, and run the main file. For example, we recommend to use VSCode
# as it provides extensions to open the database. You just have to go to the extensions 
#section and install SQLite. Each time you stop the running, you will have to run again
#the main file and enter the master password you have creted.

#2) Open the windows cmd as administrator, ans go to the directory where you saved the project
# Once in the directory, run "pyhton main.py" and the program will start running. Using this 
#option you won't be able to see the db. Once, you close the app, you will have to run
#again the same instruction "main.py" and you will be asked for the master password.

#-------------- Master password ----------------------------
#We recommend you to keep this password in a safe place, as you won't be able to acces
#the application if you forget it, and all the data will be lost.
